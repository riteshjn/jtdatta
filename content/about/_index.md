# About Mr. Jitender Datta

According to his high school certificate, Mr. Datta was born on July 16, 1940, in *Bahera* (located in present-day Pakistan). His father's name was **Arjun Das Datta** and mother's name was **Vidya Datta**. His family moved to India in 1947 during the partition.

He completed his intermediate exam in 1957 and joined the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)** in Kharagpur, India. He completed his Bachelor's in Civil Engineering in 1961, followd by his Master's in Soil Mechanics in 1962. From 1962 to 1965, he worked with **Border Roads**. From 1965 to mid-1967, he served at various places, including teaching at **the College of Military Engineering (CME)** in Pune, India. In 1967, he migrated to the United Kingdom, and got married toward the end of the same year. He worked in Scotland until August, 1969.

He migrated to the United States and worked with several consulting companies till May 1983. It was at this time that he launched his own consulting company -- Datta Consultants, Inc. He transferred his shares of the company to his employees on December 31, 2005. He started travelling in 2006, with the aim of finding some activity or occupation he would find useful. 

Now, his main occupation is to travel as much as possible while helping the deserving and needy, especially students and young entrepreneurs. 


## How he got on the  path to spirituality

When he was around 13 years old, Mr. Datta started looking for spiritual guidance. After spending some time in the process, Gita Press offered him a copy of **the Bhagvad Gita**. It was a word for word translation from Sanskrit to Hindi, with each paragraph of every shloka in Hindi. He liked its teachings and started reading it every day. In a few years, the Gita became his most important source for spiritual guidance.

A few years ago, he saw an episode of **sister Shivani**, associated with **the Brahma Kumaris**. To him, she was clarifying the teachings of Gita in easily understandable way.

Spiritually, he has grown significantly, so much so that he feels it would be unfair if he does not make efforts to pass the knowledge on to others. As a result, he decided to put together much of what he has learnt from the Gita and Shivani episodes in the form of a booklet. The idea is to distribute the booklet to as many people as possible, so they may also benefit in some way. This website is a collection of the material presented in the booklet, along with other writings of Mr. Datta, with the same idea of helping and benefiting others.
