What’s important at all time is that you keep doing good. You need to do good even when you think that others do not deserve your good, and even if others talk negative to you or about you. Eventually, it is never between you and them. At the end, it is only between you and the almighty anyway.

Follow these simple rules to improve your life:
1. Happily accept everything that comes your way as a payback of your own earlier actions. Sometimes, these might be from your earlier lives, of which you may have absolutely no knowledge.
2. In every situation, think, speak, and do only positively.
3. Stay away from all negativities all the time, especially anger.

If you sincerely implement these rules for even one month, you will start experiencing increased positivity and reduced negativity.

If you want to be happy, only look at the positive points of others, and never at their negatives. With some people, you may have to spend more time to find their positive points. Remember that it is not their fault that you are taking time to find their positive points; it is only your lack of thoughtfulness.

Be flexible with all points that are physical, which is basically anything you can see or touch. You should be completely firm with the good points and thoughts you have developed. These include positivity, happiness, love, and peace.

It is important to keep increasing your physical assets, but increasing your positive qualities requires more attention. Your positive qualities are far more superior when compared to your physical assets. After all, physical assets can help you only till your body is breathing, whereas positive qualities will keep helping your soul even after this life.

I think we’ve understood that our anger hurts just us. Anger may develop because of various external factors or people, but the fact is that I create my own anger and it hurts only me.

When it comes to how we can avoid getting angry, one method that works for me is this. I believe that all situations -- the way one talks to me, the expressions one uses to interact with me, or any problem that comes my way -- are actually the results I am getting back owing to my own previous karmic accounts.

I have no control over any such situation. Every statement that someone makes, I have no control over it; every action that someone takes, I have no control over it. What’s in my control is my being stable to train my mind, so I do not allow it to get angry and upset.

Another method that works well is my belief that all other people are completely right according to their own points of view views, even though they may be different from mine. 

Once you start winning over your own anger, you will be calm. You will be able to think, speak, and do better. You will also be able to interact with others in more positive ways. Please make extra efforts to ensure that even a little anger or negativity does not enter your thought process.

Try to evaluate yourself and determine what you want to be. Assume you want to be happy, peaceful, and full of love. Then, try to keep this in mind most of the time and hopefully, in few days, you will be with all these qualities all the time.

Another step requires developing strength and resilience. This helps you stay the way you want to be, no matter how situations around you develop. So, if someone gets angry with you, you will maintain your qualities and remain calm, happy, peaceful, and full of love. If you stay strong, other’s anger will not be able to throw you off balance. Eventually, you will spend your entire remaining life staying happy, peaceful, and full of love. Once that happens, you will like it.

Ultimately, if we keep thinking positive, and never think negative about anyone, we will keep spreading positivity in this world. We will keep increasing our own qualities and keep helping others. Our thoughts, words, and actions must revolve around love, peace, purity, bliss, knowledge, happiness, and good strength.
